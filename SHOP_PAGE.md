Shop

When the shop page is selected it will show all the recently added items to the store in clickable boxes, 2 in a row. When an item is clicked another page will come up for that item showing a more detailed description and let users choose sizes then add it to their cart.

The shop will have a dropdown menu in the top left so users can change the filters on the clothing items they're looking at e.g. mens, womens, kids.
After tapping on one of these sections it will give further options to refine your search such as jackets, shorts, etc. Users item search selection will be shown on the screen, 2 items in a row.

In the top right corner there will be a cart button, this is where all the items users add to their cart from the main part of the page will go, ready for purchase. There will be a number next to the cart icon showing how many items are in the users basket.

Next to the cart there will be a magnifying glass icon, if this is clicked a search bar will drop down so users can search for specific items, when they hit enter, the results will be shown in the middle of the screen.
