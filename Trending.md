# Trending

* This page would include the latest trending items from the **Git Active** online and also in-person shops.
* The page would also feature a **sort function** to allow the user to list these trending items by **reviews** and
  amount of **sales**(most popular) in a specified time period.
* You would also allow you to **filter** the trending items by **men/women** and **adult/child**.
* The trending page is mostly **integrated** with the **shop page** and redirects you to the product within the shop
  page where you'll be able to complete your purchase.
